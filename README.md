# team2_whack2016

We're going to create an web app that serves both people with different abilities and allies.

People with different abilities can use this site as a collegeprowler to find the right college community that is the best fit for them. We'll have spaces for current college students to comment on accessbilty on the campus, how accomodating teachers are of different abilities, etc. For allies, we have an online game to help them empathize with friends of different abilities!

We'll be adapting piercecunneen's ND-Class-Info-and-Teacher-Ratings-website framework and adapting it to our users (https://github.com/piercecunneen/ND-Class-Info-and-Teacher-Ratings-website).
